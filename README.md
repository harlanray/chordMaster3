# chord master 3

![Screenshot](images/chordMaster3.png)

What starts out as a picture of a keyboard layout. Created entirely with html & css, hopefully soon becomes a fully functional music app. However, I would love to collaborate on this project. Feel free to contribute in any way, so we can see this app to completion. The goal is to make a working digital variant of the popular nord stage keyboard. Then possibly, eventually a plugin ??

Initially appeared on [GitHub (repo)](https://github.com/harlanray/chordMaster3).

Download a copy of the code from the GitHub repo and move to desired folder on your local machine. Then you can open or drag the folder to the IDE for your choice. Once all files and folders have populated, right click on the index.html file -> click "Open with Live Server."

Project will open in deafult browser window for which you can use to help visualize edits that you make in the code, etc.
